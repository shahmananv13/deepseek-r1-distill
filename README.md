# README for Colab Notebook

## 1. Setting Up ngrok
To enable external access to the Colab notebook, you need to use ngrok. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/) and create an account if you donâ€™t have one.
2. Once logged in, go to the **Dashboard** and find your **ngrok authentication token**.
3. Copy the token and paste it into the Colab notebook when prompted to set up ngrok.

**Note:** Without the ngrok token, the notebook will not establish the required external tunnel.

## 2. Loading the vLLM Model
The notebook uses the `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B` model, which is loaded using vLLM. Please note:

1. **Initial Loading Time:** The first time the model is initialized, it will take some time to download and load the model into memory. This is normal and expected.

2. **Manual Restart Required:** Once the model is fully loaded, the Jupyter cell may still appear to be running. In this case:
    - Interrupt the execution of the cell.
    - Restart the cell to ensure the model is ready to be used.

**Important:** Do not attempt to use the model before restarting the cell after the initial load, as it may not function correctly.

By following these instructions, you can ensure the smooth operation of the Colab notebook.
